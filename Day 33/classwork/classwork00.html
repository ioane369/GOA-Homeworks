Assignment: Given a photo with a height of 1800px and a width of 1500px, calculate the ratio of height to width. 
If the desired size is 500px in width, determine the corresponding height. 
In a second scenario, given a height of 500px, calculate the corresponding width based on the same height-to-width ratio.


ratio of height to width:
1800 / 1500 = 1,2px

1) If width = 500px, height will be:
500 × 1,2 = 600px

2) If height = 500px, then width will be:
500 / 1,2 ≈ 416,67px
