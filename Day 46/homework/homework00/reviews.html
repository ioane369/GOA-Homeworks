                <h2>Review: Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Galaxy S24 Plus</strong> is the Samsung Galaxy phone that gives you everything without giving you too much. It has all the power and Galaxy AI features of Samsung's most expensive Ultra model, but it won't break the bank or give you options you'll never use, like a hidden pen.</p>
                <p> <strong>Design:</strong> With a bigger display, the Galaxy S24 Plus sits in the middle of the Galaxy S24 family, borrowing from each side of price divide. The Galaxy S24 Plus looks more like the Galaxy S24 than the Ultra, and that's too bad because the Ultra has a slick titanium frame that we enjoyed in our review.</p>    
                <p><strong>Display:</strong> Instead of just giving the Galaxy S24 Plus a bigger screen with the same resolution as the Galaxy S24, this year's Plus model has a much sharper display with more pixels, closer to the Ultra, making it a better choice than ever before.</p>
                <p><strong>Camera:</strong> Samsung offers plenty of shooting options with three lenses on the back of the Galaxy S24 Plus, including a real 3X optical zoom lens. If you need a lot more, the Ultra gives you astronomically more zoom, but the Galaxy S24 Plus has great shooting modes, plus new AI editing features in the Gallery app.</p>
                <p><strong>Performance:</strong> The Galaxy S24 Plus delivers stunning performance with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. In some benchmarks, the Snapdragon even beat the latest iPhone 15 Pro Max, so this Galaxy will handle all of your gaming, productivity, and multi-tasking needs with no trouble at all.</p>   
                <p><strong>Battery life:</strong> A big reason we love the Galaxy S24 Plus is its superlative battery life, some of the best longevity we've seen from any premium smartphone we've tested. With a bigger display and a bigger battery beneath, the Galaxy S24 Plus proves once again why it's the right premium Android pick.</p>
                <p><strong>Value for money:</strong> The Galaxy S24 Plus starts around the same price as the iPhone 15 Pro, but here's a secret: Samsung phones often go on sale. We've already seen price cuts on this phone up to 20% off in the US, and we expect more sales as the next Unpacked event approaches.</p>

                <h2>Review: Apple's iPhone 15</h2>
                <p>Apple's <strong>iPhone 15</strong> marks the most significant step up for a base iPhone in several years, earning its place as the best value phone money can buy today.</p>
                <p><strong>Design:</strong> The iPhone 15 does what the iPhone 14 did not: it moves the base model forward with a refreshed chassis design, a brand-new (and eye-catching) rear glass panel, and a compatibility-improving USB-C port.</p>    
                <p><strong>Display:</strong> The iPhone 15's 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display is bright and responsive, however, as on the iPhone 14, its refresh rate is locked to 60Hz. You do get Apple's Dynamic Island this time around, though.</p>
                <p><strong>Camera:</strong> There are still just two lenses on the back of the iPhone 15, but one of them is vastly improved over the iPhone 14. The 12MP ultrawide is basically the same, but the main camera is now the same 48MP lens that you'll find on the excellent iPhone 14 Pro (and indeed the iPhone 15 Pro).</p>
                <p><strong>Performance:</strong> The iPhone 15 uses the iPhone 14 Pro's superfast A16 Bionic chipset, which should provide more than enough power for most iPhone owners (for context, the latter was the most powerful handset of 2022).</p>
                <p><strong>Battery life:</strong> The iPhone 15 is rated for 20 hours of video playback, 80 hours of audio-only, and a 50% recharge in 30 minutes with the optional 20W charger. In our testing, we were able to use the phone casually for a full day.</p>
                <p><strong>Value for money:</strong> In recent years, Apple's standard models have felt like minor upgrades that pale in comparison to their respective Pro-level counterparts, but the iPhone 15 bucks that trend by being a genuinely great value product</p>
