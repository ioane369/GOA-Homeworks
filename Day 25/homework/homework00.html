        <img src="images/img1.jpg" width="500">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Ioane Dolidze</strong>, and I'm <strong>16 years old</strong>. I'm from <strong>Guria, Georgia</strong>, but currently living in <strong>Batumi</strong>. I'm a <strong>school student</strong>. Among the subjects I study, <strong>Georgian</strong> is my favorite. Regarding programming, I started learning about a month and a half ago, and so far, everything is going well.</p>

        <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, I have enjoyed being alone in nature. Appreciating the beauty of nature, listening to the chirping of birds, the rustling of cloudsâ€”these are the things that make me forget everything temporarily and allow me to <i>truly enjoy life.</i></p>
        <p>One of my hobbies is <strong>fishing</strong>. Fishing is a great pastime for many reasons: it's a healthy outdoor activity that connects you with nature, calms you down, improves social relationships (with family, friends, or anyone), enhances patience, strategy, and skill, promotes an appreciation for wildlife, and, if successful, provides a great dinner from your catch.</p> 

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>My skills include <strong>climbing</strong>, <strong>swimming</strong>, <strong>running</strong>, as well as having a <em>good imagination</em> (especially <em>visualization</em>), <strong>leadership qualities</strong>, <strong>emotional intelligence</strong>, and more.</p>

        <h2>Passions & Goals</h2>
        <p><em>My goal is to become the best version of myself in every aspect!</em></p>
