<!--  
Create a paragraph with a width and height of 300px, padding of 20px, and margins of 10px on the top and bottom and 30px on the left and right. The border should be of different sizes on all sides, and the element's width and height should remain as specified. Also, Explain with comments what the difference is between the standard and alternative box models.

<!--  
In standard box model width and height only include the content. Padding and border are added outside the content, increasing the total size of the element.
In alternative box model (Border-Box) width and height include content, padding, and border. This model is often easier to work with because the specified dimensions directly represent the element's total size (excluding margins).
