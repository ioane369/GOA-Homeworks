        <h1>Explaining the CSS priority tree</h1>
        <p>The CSS priority tree determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules are present. The specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Inline Styles
                <p>Inline styles have the highest priority. Styles written directly in the HTML element using the style attribute will override all other styles. For example: div style="color: red;".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                IDs
                <p>Selectors with IDs have the next highest priority. For example: #header { color: blue; } has higher specificity than a class or a tag selector.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Classes
                <p>Class selectors are next in line. For example: .button { color: green; }.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Elements
                <p>Element selectors have the lowest specificity. For example: p { color: black; }.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
