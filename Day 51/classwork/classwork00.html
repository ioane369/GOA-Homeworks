<!--  
Task: Create an element that contains text and use RGB to give it any color you want. Explain with comments how it works. Then, display an image on the site, ensuring it is responsive and always occupies 50% of the screen size. Explain this also with comments. Additionally, explain the difference between 'px' and '%'.

        <!--  
        RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, which are the primary colors of light. The RGB color model works by combining these three colors in varying intensities to produce new colors. Red, green, and blue light are each represented by a value ranging from 0 to 255. By adjusting the intensity of each color, different colors are created.

        <!--  
        Responsive means that the element (in this case, an image) adjusts its size based on the size of the screen or its parent container. This ensures that the element looks good and is functional on any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
        When we set the width of an element to 50% using "width: 50%": The element's width will always be 50% of the width of its parent container;
        As the screen size changes (e.g., when you resize your browser window or view the site on different devices), the element's width will adjust accordingly. This helps maintain a consistent and proportional layout.

        <h2>px vs %</h2>
        <!--  
        When using px (Pixels): The size remains constant regardless of screen size.
        When using % (Percent): The size changes based on the size of the parent container or the screen.
