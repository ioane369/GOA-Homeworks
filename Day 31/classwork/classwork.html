<!-- 
1) <b> (Bold): This tag makes text appear bold, typically for emphasis or to highlight key terms. 
It's a visual effect without conveying additional semantic meaning. Use this when you want text to stand out.
-->
<p>This is a <b>bold</b> word.</p>

<!--  
2) <i> (Italic): This tag renders text in italics, often used for emphasis, to indicate titles (like book or film names), 
or to denote technical terms, foreign words, or phrases. Use this when you need to distinguish text visually without strong emphasis.
-->
<p>This is an <i>italicized</i> word.</p>

<!--  
3) <del> (Deleted Text): This tag indicates that text has been deleted or removed. 
It's commonly used to show modifications or corrections. Browsers usually display this with a strikethrough line.
-->
<p>This word is <del>deleted</del>.</p>

<!--  
4) <sub> (Subscript): This tag creates subscript text, which is often used in scientific formulas, chemical equations, 
or mathematical expressions. It positions the text lower than the baseline.
-->
<p>Water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<!--  
5) <sup> (Superscript): This tag creates superscript text, often used for exponents, footnotes, 
or ordinal numbers (like 1st, 2nd). It positions the text higher than the baseline.
-->
<p>This is the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>

<!--  
6) <u> (Underline): This tag underlines text, which can be used for emphasis or to indicate links in some contexts. 
However, underlining can be confusing, as it is often associated with hyperlinks, so use it carefully to avoid misleading users.
-->
<p>This text is <u>underlined</u>.</p>


<!--  
Ordered lists <ol> show with numbers (1, 2, 3â€¦) instead of bullet points. 
Use <ol> when the points have a certain order, like step-by-step instructions.
-->

<ol>
     <li>First item</li>   <!-- <li> tag stands for "list item." It is used to define individual items within a list. -->
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ol>


<!-- 
Unordered lists use bullet points. They are useful for listing items where order doesn't matter. 
-->

<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
